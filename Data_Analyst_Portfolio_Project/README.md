Creating a **README** file for your ultra-marathon dataset project helps present your work clearly to recruiters, collaborators, or your future self.

Here’s a complete and structured example README for your project:

## 🏃 Ultra-Marathon Data Analysis 🏃

### 📊 Overview

This project explores and analyzes the **"Big Dataset of Ultra-Marathon Running"** from Kaggle. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the race performance of ultra-marathon runners (50km and 50mi) based on age, gender, season, and race type.

---

### 🧠 Key Questions Explored

* What is the difference in average speed between male and female runners in 50km and 50mi races?
* Which age groups perform the best and worst in 50mi races?
* Does the season (summer, winter, etc.) affect running speed?
* What are the most popular race lengths?

---

### 📁 Dataset

* **Source**: [Kaggle Ultra-Marathon Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sarahvch/big-data-ultra-marathon-running)
* **Attributes Used**:

  * `athlete_gender`
  * `athlete_age`
  * `athlete_average_speed`
  * `race_length` (50km, 50mi)
  * `race_date`

---

### 🧰 Tools & Libraries

* `pandas` for data manipulation
* `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for visualization
* `numpy` for numerical operations

---

### 📌 Key Insights

* **Males are generally faster** than females in both 50km and 50mi.
* **Best performance** in 50mi races comes from athletes aged around **30-39**.
* **Performance drops** after the age of 60 and below age 20.
* **Winter and spring** races have slightly better average speeds compared to **summer**.

### 📈 Sample Visualization

*(Include a sample chart or table here, e.g., a bar chart comparing average speeds by season)*

---

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sanjaykrishnank29/Machine_learning_project.git
   cd Data_Analyst_Portfolio_Project
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Data_Analyst_Portfolio_Project.ipynb
   ```

---

### ✅ Future Improvements

* Predict runner performance based on age, gender, and weather using ML
* Add elevation, heart rate, or pace per segment if available
* Build an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Plotly Dash
